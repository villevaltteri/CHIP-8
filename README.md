# CHIP-8
This is a CHIP-8 emulator written in C

## Prerequisites
To compile and run the emulator, you will need a C compiler and the SDL2 library installed on your system.
* GCC
* SDL2 library (see https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation for installation instructions)

## Compilation
* Running "make all" should add binary called chip8_emulator to root directory.
* Running "make clean" will clean up all the object files and target binary.

## Usage
* Make sure to add your ch8 files to ROMs directory
* Make sure you are in root directory and run ./chip8_emulator -g <GAME_NAME> it can be with or without .ch8




## TODO
* Technically it works right now and only kinda big thing that is missing is "BEEP" sounds
* Add missing commets
* Make code "cleaner"
